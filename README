Active Record Presenters
========================

Object oriented helpers. An alternative to passing objects around to methods defined in app/helpers/*.

 # app/presenters/post_presenter.rb
 class PostPresenter < Presenter
   def timestamp
     "Created #{object.created_at.strftime("%d")}"
   end
 end

  <%= @post.presents.timestamp %>

Instead of:

  def post_timestamp(post)
	  "Created #{post.created_at.strftime("%d")}"
  end

  <%= post_timestamp(@post) %>

Inside presenters, you can access these two methods:

* object -- the model instance in question
* helpers -- call any helper on this method

Example:

 class PostPresenter < Presenter
   def body
     helpers.textilize(object.body)
   end
 end

 <%= @post.presents.body %>

Presenters are generated with "ruby script/generate presenter [my_model]".

FYI
===

This plugin is not the same as ActivePresenter (http://github.com/giraffesoft/active_presenter/tree). ActivePresenter is for handling multiple models in one form. Active Record Presenters (this plugin) is an alternative/supplement to view helpers. I should probably change the name of this plugin to avoid the name clash.
